## Data assumptions
*  unique email addresses so emails can be used as user ID
*  user IDs must be unique integers
*  for milestone 1 we will be using emails as tokens
    *i.e. tokens are valid emails within our user database
    *we may use a separate user_id (e.g. hashable value) later
    *then tokens may change from emails to user_id or a function thereof
