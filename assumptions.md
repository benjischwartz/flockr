## Data assumptions
*  user IDs, i.e. u_id, must be unique integers
*  for milestone 1 we will be using token str(u_id)

## Channels.py assumptions
* channels_list all will list all channels, whether private or public
* channel_id will be integers, named in the order of creation
* when a channel is created, the user whose token it is matched with, will auto-matically be the first owner and member of that channel
